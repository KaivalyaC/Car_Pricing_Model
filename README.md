As the technolog is advancing, various new features are getting incorporated in vehicles. Depending upon various features the pricing of the vehicle also increases. As number of features increase it gets very difficult to decide the pricing. Therefore, it can be a frustrating and time-consuming process to quantify what a value-for-your-money purchase of a car would be like Thus we need to make a machine learning model which will help us to predict the price of a vehicle depending upon the features.

The above figures show how price of a vehile changes with the vehicle type, power and even color. 

### 1.2 Who is the Target Audiance <a class="anchor" id="target-audiance"></a>
    
Pricing of a vehicle is very important feature which decides the sale of the vehicle. Thus this model wll be useful for all the entities involved in the vehicle industry. This model will be very helpful to the following organisations.
    <ol>
        <li>Car Dealers</li>
        <li>Car Manufacturers</li>
        <li>Customers</li>
    </ol>
    
#### Car Dealers:
The model will be highly useful for the local car dealers. These car dealers usually purchase any vehicle from the manufacturer for a fixed price and sell it for higher price to get some margin. This model will help them in determining how much price they can increase for a car with given specification to maximize their margins.   
#### Car Manufacturers:
Car manufacturers can use the model to find the prospective price of the new car they want to launch and budget the manufacturing cost accordingly. They can also find which features are strongly related to price so that they can find out which features to include in which price range.
#### Customers:
The model will be ideal for customers to check the overpricing of a car as they will be able to compare the actual price of the car with ideal price of a car with similar features. Only problem is it is difficult to sell the model to car customers.

Considering all the business restrictions, Car Dealers are the ones on whom we want to focus!!
